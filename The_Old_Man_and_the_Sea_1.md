《老人与海》海明威
# 正文
**HE was an old man who fished alone in a skiff in the Gulf Stream and he had gone eighty-four days now without taking a fish.In the first forty days a boy had been with him.But after forty days without a fish the boy's  parents had told him that the old man was now definitely and finally salao,which is the worst form of unlucky,and the boy had gone a their orders in another boat which caught three good fish the first week.It made the boy sad to see the old man come in each day with his skiff empty and he always went down to help him carry either the coiled lines or the gaff and harpoon and the sail that was furled around the mast. the sail was patched with flour sacks and,furled,it looked like the flag of permanent defeat.**

- *他是一个在墨西哥湾流钓鱼的老人，他已经84天没有钓到过鱼了。在第一个四十天有一个男孩陪着他。但是随后的四十天仍然没钓到鱼，这个男孩的父母对告诉男孩，这个老人现在是倒霉的（definitely and finally salao，古巴俗语，加了盐的，不吉利的，倒霉的），男孩遵从父母的命令离开了这艘船加入了另一艘船，在第一周就抓到了三条好大的鱼。看着老人每天空着船回来男孩很难过，男孩总是过去帮助老人帮运盘绕的绳索，鱼钩和鱼叉以及帆架周围的船帆。这个帆用面粉袋修补过，缩成一团，看起来就像一面象征失败的旗子。*

**The old man was thin and gaunt with deep wrinkles in the back of his neck.The brown blotches of the benevolent skin cancer the sun brings from its reflection on the tropic sea were on his cheeks. The blotches ran well down the sides of his face and his hands had the deep-creased scars from handling heavy fish on the cords. But none of these scars were fresh. They were as old as erosions in a fishless desert.**

- *这个老人又瘦又憔悴，脖子后面有很深的皱纹。他的脸颊有着棕色的斑点，那是由于长期太阳在热带海面上反射的光线引起的良性皮肤癌变。这些棕色斑点从他脸的两侧一直蔓延下去，他的双手经常用绳索拉大鱼，留下了很深的疤痕。但这些疤痕是很久以前的了，它们像无鱼可打的沙漠中被侵蚀的地方一样古老。*

**Everything about him was old except his eyes and they were the same color as the sea and were cheerful and undefeated.**

- *他身体的每一个部分都显示他的衰老，除了他的眼睛，他的眼有着和海洋一样的颜色，开朗永不颓废。*

**"Santiago,"the boy said to him as they climbed the bank from where the skiff was hauled up."I could go with you again . We're made some money."
The old man had taught the boy to fish and they boy loved him.
"No," the old man said."you're with a lucky boat.Stay with them."
"But remember how you went eighty-seven days without fish and then we caught big ones every day for three weeks."
"I remember,"the old man said."I know you did not leave me because you doubted."
"It was papa made me leave,I am a boy and I must obey him"
"I know,"the old man said."It is quite normal."
"He hasn't much faith."
"No,"the old man said."But we have.Haven't we?"
'Yes," the boy said."Can I offer you a beer on the Terrace and then we'll take the stuff home."
"Why not?"the old man said"Between fishermen."**

- *"桑迪亚哥",当他们把小船拖上岸的时候男孩对他说"我能继续和你一起捕鱼，我们之前也赚了一些钱。"*

- *老人教男孩捕鱼，男孩敬爱这个老人。*

- *"不",老人说"你跟着一条幸运的船，继续待在那儿。"*

- *"但是你记得你过去曾经87天没有钓到鱼，然后接下来的三个星期，我们每天都能抓到大家伙"*

- *"我记得"老人说"我知道你不是因为失去对我的信心而离开我"*

- *"是我爸爸让我离开的，我还是个小孩，我必须听他的"*

- *"我知道"老人说"这很正常"*

- *"他太没信心了"*

- *"是的"老人说"但我们有啊，不是吗?"*

- *"是的"男孩说"让我请你到露天酒吧喝杯啤酒吧，然后我们再带这些东西回去"*

- *"好啊"老人说:"渔民之间的友谊"*

**They sat on the Terrace and many of the fishermen made fun of the old man and he was not angry.Others, of the older fishermen,looked at him and were sad.But they did not show it and they spoke politely about the current and the depths they had drifted their lines at and the steady good weather and of what they had seen.The successful fishermen of that day were already in and had butchered their marlin out and carried them laid full length across two planks,with two men staggering at the end of each plank,to the fish house where they waited for the ice truck to carry them to the market in Havana. Those who had caught sharks had taken them to the shark factory on the other side of the cove where they were hoisted on a block and tackle,their livers removed,their fins cut off and their hides skinned out and their flesh cut into strips for salting.**

- *他们坐到了露天酒吧，很多之前坐在那里的渔夫嘲笑老人，老人没有生气。另外的渔夫，那些老渔夫没有嘲笑老人，只是用担忧的眼神看着老人。他们没有把担忧表露出来而是继续很礼貌的谈论鱼线的垂钓深度，稳定的好天气以及他们听到的一些事情。成功钓到鱼的渔夫都已经回来了，他们将马林鱼剖开摊平在两块木板上，两个人一人抬一边走进鱼屋，等待冷冻车载他们去哈瓦那的市场。那些抓到鲨鱼的渔夫，已经将鲨鱼送到小海湾的另一边的鲨鱼工厂去了。在那里，鲨鱼被悬挂在滑轮上，然后被移除肝脏，割掉鳍，剥掉皮，将肉切成条状用盐腌*
